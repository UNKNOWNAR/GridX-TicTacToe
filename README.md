This is a project jointly developed by Arinjay Sarkar from Instrumentation and Electronics Engineering branch of Jadavpur University and Aditya Mukherjee from Computer Science branch of St. Xavier's College(Autonomous), Kolkata.
The app is developed in Unity.
We have two modes - SinglePlayer and MultiPlayer.
SinglePlayer has four difficulty levels - Easy, Medium, Hard and Impossible.
We claim that you cannot defeat the SinglePlayer AI on Impossible difficulty.
In MultiPlayer Mode you can play locally against your friend in 3x3 and 5x5 modes.
